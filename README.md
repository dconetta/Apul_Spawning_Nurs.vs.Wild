# Apul_Spawning_Nurs.vs.Wild

Introduction:

This repository holds data collected on the reproductive capacity of Acropora pulchra colonies from the wild and nursery 
sites in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. These data are held under the RAnalysis folder under the "Data" folder which is separated
by the years data was collected (2019 and 2020). These data were collected by Dennis Conetta, Kevin Wong, and Danielle 
Becker of the Putnam Lab as well as Laetitia Hedioun, Yann Lacube, Camille Leonardson and all volunteers of CRIOBE
research station in Mo'orea French Polynesia. These data are aparat of a long-term reproductive time series on Acroporid 
corals.

Structure of Repository:

In the RAnlaysis folder there are two R markdown files and a PDF file that are separate from the folders that are
described below. The first RMD file is a breakdown and explanation of all the code used to produce all the figures
and analysis for these data - this file is called "Code+Figure_Explanations_BIO-539". The second RMD file is a mock
manuscript which is the formal write up of the data in a RMD and is paired with the PDF file which is the output file
produced from this RMD file. These are both called "Final_Project_Conetta_Coral-Reproduction". 

This repository is broken down into four major folders; Data, Metadata, Scripts, and Output. Data holds all the data 
collected at each spawning season (eggs per bundle, fecundity egg counts, fecundity wax dip/surface area, egg size, and 
fertilization data) and further subdivided into folder for each of the years of recorded data to date (2019 and 2020).

Metadata holds the entire breakdown of all the coral colonies collected in 2020 and what metrics we have measured for each
of those colonies.

Scripts hold the six R scripts that are used to analyze the data and produce figures for this data. These scripts help 
analyze and produce the figures for the five major metrics we use to compare reproductive capcity of nursery-reared and
wild Acropora pulchra colonies : Eggs per bundle, egg size, egg ratio, fecundity (number of eggs per cm^2 of coral), and 
fertilization success.

Output holds all the figures produced in the Script codes. These are further subdivided into folders within holding the
individual year's figures while the few free files in the Output folder are the combined years and final figures that are
included in the Final_Project file in the RAnalysis

All these files are updated through github and annotated for data transparency and reproducibility
